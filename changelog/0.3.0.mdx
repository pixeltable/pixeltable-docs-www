# v0.3.0

**Released:** January 17, 2025
**Author:** [@aaron-siegel](https://github.com/aaron-siegel)
**View on GitHub:** [v0.3.0](https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

## Important
This release contains a few breaking API changes. The most significant change is that the deprecated syntax for adding columns has been removed. This will now generate an error:
```python
t['my_col'] = ...
```
Instead, do the following:
```python
t.add_computed_column(my_col=...)
```
Please refer to the Pixeltable documentation (https://pixeltable.readme.io/) for additional details.
